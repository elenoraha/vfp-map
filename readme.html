This is a project of an election map that I built on wordpress. I've removed all aspects of the code except for those pertaining to the map. 
However, I've included all of the base Wordpress files to make it easier for you to view the project. This is a much larger git repo than I normally would commit.

The work to review lives in the child theme: wp-content/themes/authentic_theme/. 

I've included a database in the public directory: vfp-map-db.sql.gz

While I've written all files in the child theme, the key elements of the project are:
1. tpl-map.php 
2. part-mapUSA.php
3. content-state.php
4. /map-parts/.
5. /js/main.js - Ajax Map
6. functions.php - Ajax Map
